\section{Conclusion and Future Improvements}
\textbf{Conclusion:}
The final project successfully met all design requirements for a flexible 
four-way traffic light controller. The group gained practical experience in 
applying microcontroller programming techniques, including Timer/Interrupt handling, 
and interfacing with key peripherals like LCDs and buttons.

\textbf{Future Work:}
To enhance the system for real-world application, future developments could include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implementing sensor input (e.g., inductive loops or cameras) to dynamically adjust $T_{Green}$ based on real-time traffic flow (Smart Traffic Light).
    \item Integrating a communication module (e.g., UART or ESP8266 Wi-Fi) for remote monitoring and centralized control.
\end{enumerate}
