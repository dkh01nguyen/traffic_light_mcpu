\subsection{The Microcontroller Unit (MCU)}

\subsection{Interfacing with LCD 16x2}
The LCD 16x2 module based on the HD44780 controller is used for information display. In this assignment, our display
use an I2C shield in order to communicate with the MCU.

\subsection{LED module for traffic lights}

\subsection{Buttons and Debouncing}
The system uses four pull-up configured pushbuttons. Software debouncing 
(typically 20ms delay) with timer interrupt rather than using \code{HAL\_Delay()} is 
implemented to ensure reliable signal readings from the mechanical switches.
